One thing we truly value at Central is community. And whether today is your first time or Central has been your church for years, truly, the best way to get connected with our family and start meeting others is through Groups. These are so much more than quick chats or handshakes at church. Small groups are where you can develop real and lasting friendships that go beyond Sunday morning. To find the group perfect for you, simply head to the big blue wall in the lobby. We’ll see you there!
