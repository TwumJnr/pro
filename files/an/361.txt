If you’re new with us today, we want you to feel at home and know that this is a safe place—and we’re so glad to have you here. For us, church is so much more than just a Sunday service, and we want you to know that there’s a place perfect for you at Central. One of the best ways you can get connected with us is to fill out the blue card in the seat back in front of you. Take that card out sometime during the worship experience and fill out as much information as you feel comfortable sharing. And then, after the service, take that card to the big blue wall in the lobby and we’ll put a small gift in your hands. Just a small token of our appreciation for you being here. And that’s it! Later this week one of our pastors will connect with you. And once again, thanks for being here
